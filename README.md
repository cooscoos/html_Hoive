# Html Hoive (no longer maintained)

Don't use this; use the [maintained websocket Hoive repo](https://github.com/cooscoos/Hoive).

This repo uses an html server to manage games of Hoive and is no longer maintained --- it's provided for reference only, and is outdated.

To use:

Choose one of the following directories and do `cargo run`:
- **client**: play locally (couch co-op) or on a Hoive game web server, or;
- **server**: host a Hoive game web server.

The Hoive directory contains the game logic.
